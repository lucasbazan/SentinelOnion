## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Docker

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucasbazan/SentinelOnion.git
cd SentinelOnion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🔍 Usage

1. Discover websites in search engines

Query directories and search engines from the selected networks and store results in a file:
```bash
python3 main.py discover --network tor,i2p --keywords "drugs,market" --output websites.txt
```
This will generate websites.txt with the discovered URLs.

2. Crawl and analyze websites

Load websites from a list and apply YARA/Regex detection:
```bash
python3 main.py crawl --input websites.txt
```

Or crawl a single URL:
```bash
python3 main.py crawl --url http://example.onion
```

Or via pipe (stdin):
```bash
echo "http://example.onion" | python3 main.py crawl
```

3. Export results to JSON or CSV

```bash
python3 main.py crawl --input websites.txt --output results[.json|.csv]
```

🧾 YARA & Regex Rules

Custom detection rules are stored in the rules/ folder.
You can add your own rules to detect:

- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Emails
- Usernames
- Credentials
- Any custom pattern

Example (Bitcoin wallet detection):

```yara
rule Bitcoin_Wallet {
  strings:
    $btc = /[13][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{25,34}/
  condition:
    $btc
}
```

- Expose metrics to Prometheus
- Integrate with ELK (Elasticsearch + Kibana)
